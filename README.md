# Euchre.Web

<p>I am making a web version of my favourite card game Euchre using React TS + Vite. ♥️♠️♦️♣️</p>

### July 31st update
Collaboration effort to re-factor the Euchre game engine to use redux, current todo is integrating the new game engine into the current user interface, and completing the remaining todos to finish the game as a single player game with 3 computer players.

### Learned skills so far:
- Redux and Redux Toolkit
- Learning React and TypeScript
- React hooks: useState, useContext, useRef, useEffect
- Encapsulating my game logic so that this project can be more easily re-factored in the future to include a variety of similar trick-based card games
- Learned how to use async/await and resolving Promises
- Gained experience in building an intuitative user interface and comfortable user experience
- Organizing my project: Models, interfaces, components and functions are in their separate locations

### Getting started

1. `npm install`

2. `npm run dev`
