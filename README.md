# Euchre.Web

<p>I am making a web version of my favourite card game Euchre using React TS + Vite. ♥️♠️♦️♣️</p>

### August 9th update

<p> Current effort is to finish off the comptuer players' playing algorithm. Bidding, declaring, choosing trump and discarding is done first draft, playing cards algorithm is last TODO.</p>

### July 31st update

Collaboration to re-factor the Euchre game engine to use redux, current todo is integrating the new game engine into the current user interface, and completing the remaining todos to finish the game as a single player game with 3 computer players.

### Learned skills so far:

- Global state management
- Redux and Redux Toolkit
- Learning React and TypeScript
- React hooks: useState, useContext, useRef, useEffect
- Algorithms for computer players
- Encapsulating my game logic so that this project can be more easily re-factored in the future to include a variety of similar trick-based card games
- Learned how to use async/await and resolving Promises
- Gained experience in building an intuitative user interface and comfortable user experience
- Organizing my project: Models, interfaces, components and functions are in their separate locations

### Getting started

1. `npm install`
